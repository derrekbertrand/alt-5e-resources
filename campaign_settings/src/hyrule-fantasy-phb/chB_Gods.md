# Gods of Hyrule

## Golden Goddesses

**Din - CG**  
**War**  
Din is one of the three creator-goddesses. She stands for progress and advancement in the face of tribulation. She values those with the power and ambition to move the world along the course of fate.

She is represented by three stacked wavy lines.

**Farore - G**  
**Life**  
Farore is the second of the three creator-goddesses. She created all the lesser deities, fey, and the first mortal beings. She, above all else, values the life that the realm sustains.

She is represented by a circle enclosed by two crescents.

**Nayru - LG**  
**Knowledge**  
Nayru is the third of the three creator-goddesses. She treasures wisdom and law. She prefers the order that mortals create for themselves over divine intervention.

She is represented by three opposing crescents, each with a circle inside them.

## Lesser Deities

**Deku Tree - L**  
**Nature, Knowledge**  
The Deku Tree is the guardian of the forest. His duties include protecting the forest from intruders, spreading the sacred forest, and safeguarding treasures of the royal family. The Deku Tree is steadfast in his duties to the realm and will die before failing to complete them. The Deku Tree is the creator and patron deity of the Kokiri.

His symbol is the opposing crescent symbol - the shape of the metal in the Kokiri emerald.

**Goddess of the Sands - C**  
**Trickery, Nature**  
The Goddess of the Sands is the matron deity of the Gerudo. The harsh and relentless desert is her domain. She seems to enjoy toying with mortals.

Her symbol is the crescent moon and four-point-star.

**Hylia - G**  
**Life, Light**  
Hylia is the matron deity of the Hylians and Sheikah. Hylia is charged with preventing misuse of the Triforce and shepherding mortals. At some point, Hylia was forced to give up her immortality and reincarnate as a mortal Hylian. Her line became the royal family of Hyrule, who took up her duties. The Sheikah, in turn, pledged their loyalty to the royal family. Worship of Hylia as a goddess has since waned.

Hylia's seal is the same as the royal family, a large bird, possibly with the Triforce atop its head.

**Jabun - N**  
**Tempest, Nature**  
Jabun or Jabu-Jabu is the giant deity of Hyrule's waterways. He protects the fountain that feeds Hyrule's primary river. He has been known to speak, if only in more ancient tongues.

His symbol is three opposing crescents, a partial representation of Nayru's symbol.

**Volvagia - C**  
**War, Light**

## Gods of Evil

**Demise - LE**  
**War, Light**  
Demise may take many forms, but at his core he is the opposing force to the three goddesses. The Golden Goddesses created the world for the benefit of mortal races, and the Triforce to maintain the providence of the land. Demise seeks to oppose that order and use the Triforce to create a world in his image.

In general, Demise is symbolized by the inverted triangle - the Triforce fragment of power.

**God of Death - E**  
**Death, Knowledge**  
Also known as the God of Truth, this deity was the original patron god of the Sheikah race. At some point during Hyrule's history the Sheikah decided to serve the goddess Hylia instead, but the civil strife nearly destroyed the entire tribe. Not much is known about this deity other than it stands for the utter destruction of mortals.

Its seal is a large eye with a tear drop falling from it.

**Vaati - CE**  
**Tempest, Death**  
Vaati embodies corruption in the hearts of men. Once a Minish apprentice, he wished for power to transcend his position and take his place among immortals. Vaati believes himself to be above all mortals, and seeks only to fulfill whatever his current desires are.

Vaati is often symbolized by an ornate eye.
