## Currency Mapping

Hyrule and its sister planes usually use Rupees as their currency. I generally map currencies according to the listing below for reasons that should be rather obvious. Most things are priced in silver or gold, so it makes sense not to change these if at all possible.

    Copper   -> Rupee (Green)  
    Silver   -> Silver Rupee  
    Electrum -> Purple Rupee  
    Gold     -> Gold Rupee  
    Platinum -> Giant Rupee

## Armor and Weapons

In the realms of the goddesses there are a variety of unique armor and weapons to find. There are also a lot of creatures that can eat or destroy your beloved items, so take care!

**Wooden Shield - 2 Gold**  
+1 AC; 3 lbs. A small, light shield made of wood and branded with an emblem or symbol. When this shield is equipped and the wielder takes damage of the fire type roll a d20: if the number is less than 11 the Wooden Shield is burnt to ashes and permanently destroyed.

**Small Shield - 4 Gold**  
+1 AC; 4 lbs. A small, unassuming, iron shield.

**Hylian Shield - 10 Gold**  
+2 AC; 6 lbs. A solid shield made of Hylian steel. Usually decorated to show the status of the wielder.

**Red Shield - 25 Gold**  
+2 AC; 8 lbs. A steel shield of high quality, decorated with rich red hues. Because of the thick red lacquer coating the shield, it cannot be digested by monsters who eat metal.

## Bottles and Liquids

Nothing is more rare and precious than a glass bottle. In other realms you can buy glass bottles by the case, but in the realms of the goddesses these items are harder to come by. The skills and resources to make glass are rare, so glass bottles of any kind are hard to find. Most shopkeepers just expect that you bring your own container, because they certainly aren't going to part with any of their glassware.

Glass bottles hold up to 1 1/2 pints of liquid, usually must be strapped to the outside of your pack, and weigh just a few ounces empty. These are just a few of the things you can put in a glass bottle:

**Acid - 25 Gold**  
See player's handbook. You can keep 6 uses in a bottle.

**Alchemist's Fire - 50 Gold**  
See player's handbook. You can keep 1 use in a bottle.

**Antitoxin - 50 Gold**  
See player's handbook. You can keep up to 6 uses in a bottle.

**Blue Fire - 100 Gold**  
This magical blue flame burns even in the absence of oxygen or material to oxidize. It is not harmful, and cannot catch fire to other objects. It may have other specific uses. One use fits in a bottle.

**Blue Potion - 150 Gold**  
This potion restores the same as both a red and green potion combined (calculate both their effects). You can keep up to 6 uses in a bottle.

**Fairy's Spirit - 200 Gold**  
Functions the same as a Red Potion, except only one can be kept in a bottle. If the bearer's HP falls below 1, the effect is activated immediately after damage is dealt. If the player is unstable, their condition is stabilized.

**Green Potion - 100 Gold**  
A character who drinks this magical green liquid regains up to 1d4+2 sorcery points worth of spell slots, as long as they have empty spell slots to gain. This can be used by any class with spell slots. For Warlocks, this always restores exactly one spell slot. You can keep up to 6 uses in a bottle. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.

**Lon Lon Milk - 10 Gold**  
-- Redesign --

**Oil - 1 Silver**  
See player's handbook. You can keep up to 1 use in a bottle.

**Poe's Soul - 10 Gold**  
Administer like a potion. Only one will fit in a bottle. Roll a d6 and do the following:

1. Creature is poisoned.
2. Same effect as Green Potion, except the spell slots are expended instead of regained. You can't lose more spell slots than you have.
3. Same effect as Red Potion, except the value is taken as poison damage instead of restored.
4. Same effect as Blue Potion.
5. Same effect as Green Potion.
6. Same effect as Red Potion.

**Poison, basic - 100 Gold**  
See player's handbook. You can keep up to 6 uses in a bottle.

**Red Potion (Potion of Healing) - 50 Gold**  
See player's handbook. You can keep up to 6 uses in a bottle.
