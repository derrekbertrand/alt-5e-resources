# Introduction

DnD operates on a specific-beats-generic system of rule overriding. This document utilizes that to override and append to the core rules in-line with the [SRD](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd).

## The Hyrule Fantasy

In 1986 Nintendo Company Limited changed the way we play Role Playing Games. Nintendo has a certain way of making you rethink the familiar, and Japan has a certain way of taking western ideas and taking them far beyond what the west could have imagined. The forests and caves of Hyrule beckon. Invite some friends over, grab a bottle of Chateau Romani, and let's all escape to Hyrule... if only for a little while.

This addendum to the SRD is a set of rules to bring some of that special Hylian magic to the tabletop. We have written stats for some of the most beloved fictional races of all time, a special list of bottled items, and more. There is a small, but growing, pantheon of gods for you to follow. We even added shield variants. These are intended to add Hylian flavor to your tabletop games.
