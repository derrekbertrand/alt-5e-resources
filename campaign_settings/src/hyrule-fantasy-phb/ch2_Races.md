## Forest Spirits

*“The children of the forest, the
Kokiri, live here with me.”*

Referred to as the children of the forest, the Kokiri are forest spirits born from ancient trees in the deep forests of Hyrule. Being spirits of the forest, they can live practically indefinitely. They do not age, but remain children in form. This may lead to horrible misconceptions about their wisdom.

It is said that if children become lost in the sacred forest, that they could become Kokiri. However, they could also become a Stalkid (Skull Kid) if they do not have the blessings of the forest spirits.

Most Kokiri never leave their villages or the safety of the forbidden forest. Hylians that don't live on the edges of the sacred forest might not have met anyone who has seen a Kokiri. Moreover most residents of Hyrule might mistake a Kokiri for a Hylian child.

They live as embodiments of nature, and spend most of their time taking care of the forest and its animal inhabitants. Occasionally the desire to perform some greater task will cause a Kokiri to leave the sacred forest, but these occurrences are rather rare.

The Kokiri's stealthy nature, wisdom, and charisma make them suited to casting, trading, thieving, or acting as an agent.

## Gerudo

*“Gerudos are beautiful and brave...
They are just so fascinating!”*

The Gerudo hail from the western desert regions. Even the weakest of them are experts in fighting with their weapon of choice. From a young age they are taken to the tribal training grounds. There, they are instructed in their cultural weaponry. Some are trained to dual-wield scimitars, while the more muscular of them are trained with glaives.

While Hylians would condemn their entire race as thieves, this isn't the case. Most Gerudo travel far and wide trading with the west, practice husbandry, or even take work as security detail for the rich. Nonetheless, life is hard when you live in the desert, and some groups are driven to take from those more well off.

The Gerudo are also heralded as beautiful. This doesn't mean there aren't uncharismatic Gerudo. Some have pretty abrasive personalities that more than counteract their beauty.

The Gerudo are a flexible race that could take up any occupation, although they have a tendency to excel at combat and trade.

## Goron

*“I am one of the Gorons,
the stone-eating people who live
on Death Mountain.”*

Gorons of Death Mountain are strong and prideful. They have little need to depart from the mountain, because their primary food source (rocks, of all things) is readily found there. They hold their beliefs close, and take them very seriously. Some try to uphold the law of the land, while others form their own convictions based on tribal bonds.

Gorons have historically conducted a lot of trade with Hylians. They harvest and diffuse bomb flowers and sell them to the Hylian market. They also sell dodongo stomachs, and make clothing to help Hylians withstand the heat of Death Mountain. They also help extract rupees from Death Mountain's crater.

While all of this trade could probably have made the Gorons rich, they exchange a portion of these goods as tribute to the royal family. In return, the road to Death Mountain is secured, the Gorons have complete autonomy, and the royal family is sworn to help the Gorons in their time of need.

With their superior strength, fire resistance, and fighting ability, they make great travel companions.

Your Constitution score increases by 1; your Strength score increases by 2.

**Speed:**
Your base walking speed is 20 feet.

- You may move up to three times your base speed in a straight line.

## Hylian

*“Ho ho ho!  
You Hylians...you are such silly
creatures!”*

Hylians are the primary inhabitants of Hyrule. They have pointy ears that are said to allow them to hear the gods, although this is disputed.

Hylians are known for being fairly adept at most things. Perhaps not as strong as the Gorons or as beautiful as the Gerudo, but as strong and beautiful as they need to be. Hylians make great bards or any other character that needs to have a diverse skillset.

Hylians tend to live in settlements with other Hylians, and they are the only race known to build massive cities like Castletown. They build these fortified settlements all over Hyrule, and in their dealings with other races, often learn a foreign language from the locals.

Some humans, mostly foreigners, do not have the pointy ears of Hylians, but have basically all the other traits of Hylians. These humans blend into Hylian society quite nicely, and for the purpose of this text are considered “Hylian” in the racial sense.

Hylians do not have any particular skills or traits that make them unique, but they are a rather balanced and prolific race.

### Hylian Traits

**Speed:**
Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Languages:**
You know common. You can pick another standard language for your character to speak, read, and write.

## Sheikah

*“Have you heard the legend of the 'Shadow Folk'?  
They are the Sheikah...the shadows of the Hylians.”*

Sheikah are a tribe of ninjas said to be the original inhabitants of Kakariko. They serve the royal family of Hyrule as spies and agents. Sheikah are rarely seen at all as part of that pact, and it is unknown how many Sheikah there actually are. If the Sheikah do have a settlement, it is likely that the entire village is hidden.

Not much is known about Sheikah culture, and they don't seem keen on divulging any information. What is known is that they are a very intelligent and dexterous race, and that all of the Sheikah have had at least some combat training. Most denizens of Hyrule do not trust the Sheikah, and aren't used to seeing them about.

While most Sheikah are busy serving the Hyrule royal family, some have been known to go on quests. Their reasoning differs. Some are under the direction of the God of Truth that sleeps in the depths of Hyrule, others perhaps have a special task that requires their attention.

Sheikah could be well suited to many different trades. One should not discount their martial prowess, though.

### Sheikah Traits

Your Dexterity and Intelligence increase by 1.

Sheikah can live for hundreds of years, though perhaps not in the greatest of health.

**Ninja Training:**
You have the Martial Adept feat.

**Languages:**
You can read, write, and speak Common and Sheikah.

## Zora

*“We are the Zoras, the proud aquatic people!”*

The Zora have long served the royal family as the protectors of the waterways of Hyrule. By securing the rivers and lakes, and keeping the water deities happy they ensure a prosperous, green Hyrule.

Zora mainly live in Zora's Fountain or Lake Hylia. Water living is far more comfortable for them, so they don't often bother to leave these places. The ones that do are often great traders or heros.

The Zora make sure to educate their people in the ways of reading and writing. Their great collections of scholarly works rivals that of the Hyrulean Library.

Zora are hearty, intelligent adventurers who can take up a number of trades. Because of their stamina and Electrical Defense traits, even the weakest of them are hard to kill.
