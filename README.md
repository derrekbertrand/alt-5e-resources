## Alternative Character Sheets

There are two alternative character sheets: one for casters, and another for non-casters. Note the following changes:
- Sheet uses the charming [Quattrocento](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Quattrocento) font by [Pablo Impallari](https://github.com/impallari?tab=repositories).
- Removed Inspiration, as my games don't use it and the DM should probably keep track of that detail.
- Initiative moved to skill block. I realize it isn't a "skill", but it is a common [ability check](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/ability-check), and I needed to save space.
- Armor Class moved to where inspiration was to save space.
- Crunched skills in to include Passive Perception in that real-estate.
- Minimized "Background" block into a "Personality Notes" section. You can put background info on a 2nd sheet.
- Made better use and organization of the HP/Hit Dice section.
- Expanded attack/spell section with more boxes for info, 5 unique attack slots, and 3 free-form lines under each attack for notes.
- **For Non-Casters:**
  - Expanded area for Languages and Proficiencies.
  - Massive free-form area for notes on Features and Traits.
- **For Casters:**
  - Dedicated Features and Traits area to spell notes and boxes to keep casting info.

## Campaign Settings

Campaign setting resources are located in their respective folder. If you are used to viewing markdown, you can look at the individual chapters in plain text or a browser. The resources are in the src folder. There is a folder for each document, and a markdown metadata header for each one as well.

If you have XeTeX, pandoc, and the required fonts installed; you can run the pdfgen.sh script, which generates complete PDF documents from the source files. If there is a demand, I'll set up a server that can host the complete PDFs, but as of now there's no good reason to do so.
